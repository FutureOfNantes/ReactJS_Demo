# Ethereum Smart Contract workshop

This is an Ethereum Smart Contract tutorial which requires no prior experience 
with Smart Contract development, as all the tutorial steps are detailed and 
explained. It has a step by step guide how to set-up a development and testing 
environment for Ethereum Smart Contracts, then a section on writing and testing 
simple Smart Contract. Finally it shows how to create an example web UI 
application that interacts with the Smart Contract.   

## Workshop Overview
* Setup local development and testing environment for Ethereum Smart Contracts
* Write simple Ethereum Smart Contract using Solidity development language
* Write tests for the Smart Contract
* Write very simple DApp (distributed Application) - that interacts with the 
Smart Contract using web3.js API

### What we will build?
The final result of the workshop will be simple distributed application with UI 
running on local node.js server and interacting with an `EventTickets` 
Smart Contract deployed on local Blockchain network. 
The application and Smart Contract we are going to build is a simplified event
tickets purchase platform. This platform will:
- allow anyone to buy a ticket for an event
- allow event organiser to refund previously bought ticket
- allow event organiser change tickets quota for an event
- allow event organiser to collect money for the tickets bought

The difference of this DApp and traditional application is that key application 
logic and state (number of attendees, money received for tickets, attendees 
list etc.) will be kept in the Smart Contract. Also all payments and refunds for 
the tickets will be done in Ethereum Blockchain network using Ether 
crypto-currency. Also there is no central application server and database as 
Blockchain network is ditributed. This is why the application is called 
`distributed` application - DApp.

### Workshop DApp
Below you can see a diagram of the Smart Contract development, testing and local 
deployment environment that we will use for this workshop. Also this diagram 
shows DApp interactions with the `EventTickets` Smart Contract deployed on 
the local Blockchain network through 4 actions:
- Buy ticket
- Change quota
- Refund Ticket
- Self-destruct

The `Initialise Contract` action is done on initial DApp load. All DApp 
interactions with Blockchain network happen via `web3.js` library.

Note this diagram also shows 3 main development tools and applications we will 
use in the workshop: `Truffle`, `Ganache` and `Metamask`. These will be covered 
in section 
[1. Local Development, Testing and Deployment Environment](#1-set-up-local-development-testing-and-deployment-environment)
below.

### Background reading 
You should familiarize yourself more with:
* Blockchain
* Ethereum Smart Contracts
* Ethereum Virtual Machine, Ethereum Node
* DApp (distributed Application)

### Prerequisites
* General software engineering and development understanding and some 
experience.
* Unix-based system would be the best option. All further environment setup 
instructions prepared and tested on Mac OS, however, it should work on any OS. 
* Preferred IDE for Smart Contract development. You can use any IDE you like, 
for example the one you already have installed. If you like to try something 
new, there is an interesting one - browser based IDE - one of the top tools 
for Smart Contract development - [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org).

## 1. Set up local Development, Testing and Deployment Environment
Smart Contract development and testing environment consist of local Blockchain 
network - `Ganache`, development command-line tool `Truffle` and `node.js` 
with `web3.js` javascript library for interacting with Smart Contracts. To 
interact with real Ethereum Blockchain network, one needs a local Ethereum 
node. However, for the development and testing environment Ethereum node is 
not needed, as `Ganache` has a RPC server, which allows `Truffle` and `web3.js` 
to interact with local Blockchain network. You can optionally install `MetaMask` 
which is local crypto-currency wallet. It will allow you to make transactions 
between you local testing accounts. See the [diagram](#Workshop-DApp) above.

### Environment setup
Installation guides bellow will assume Mac OS system. Guides for other OSs
can be found using the same links below and navigating to appropriate OS pages.

#### Install nodejs
Download and install latest node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 
Install nodejs by unpacking it and adding to the `PATH`.
```bash
$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/nodejs
$ sudo tar -xJvf node-v10.16.3-darwin-x64.tar -C /usr/local/lib/nodejs
$ export PATH=/usr/local/lib/nodejs/node-v10.16.3-darwin-x64/bin:$PATH
```
Note: Make npm and node commands accessible for your user (without sudo). Run 
```bash
$ mkdir ~/.npm-packages
$ npm config set prefix ~/.npm-packages
```
Finally, verify the install:
```bash
$ node -v
$ npm version
```
Download older (10.16.3) version of node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.3/).

#### Create your project path
Create your workshop tutorial directory and continue all further steps in 
that path:
```bash
$ mkdir ~/workshop
$ cd ~/workshop
```

#### Setup Truffle
Truffle is a world class development environment, testing framework and asset 
pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
Install truffle using npm:
```bash
$ npm install -g truffle@5.1.0
```
Start truffle with default directory structure with some boilerplate code:
```bash
$ truffle init
```

#### Setup Ganache
Ganache is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to 
deploy contracts, develop your applications, and run tests. It is a test
Ethereum node - safe and free to run as it creates your private testing 
blockchain network. Download Ganache from 
[here](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache). 
Old version (2.1.0) of Ganache can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache/releases/tag/v2.1.0).
Start Ganache and create a 
new workspace (or use Quickstart option). Once started Ganache run on 
address `127.0.0.1:7545`. 
Link your truffle project (the workshop project directory created above) 
with your Ganache Ethereum node by pressing `Settings` button at the top 
right corner. Save the workshop workspace.

#### Install MetaMask (optional)
MetaMask is a self-hosted wallet to store, send and receive ETH.
This is an optional step as it is not used in out final DApp - however, it 
is very light tool which allows to quickly see how transactions in the 
Ethereum Blockchain work.
Download MetaMask Chrome extension [here](https://metamask.io/).
When installed, press `Get Started` and select `Import Wallet` option.
Import an account by entering the mnemonic that is displayed in Ganache and
password.
Once in the MetaMask wallet change `Main Network` at the drop down at the 
top right corner: select `Custom RPC`. Then create new network by entering
Ganache RPC: `http://127.0.0.1:7545`. Once saved - local testing account index 0 
should be visible in the dashboard. You can add other accounts to the MetaMask 
from your Ganache dev-accounts list. 

## 2. Write the Smart Contract
In this section we will write a simple Smart Contract code and deploy it to the 
local Blockchain network.

### EventTickets Smart Contract code
The Smart Contract has:
- 4 public attributes (organizer, registrantsPaid, numRegistrants and quota)
- constructor function
- 4 public functions (buyTicket(), changeQuota(), refundTicket() and destroy())

Create in file in contracts directory for your first Smart Contract: 
`contracts/EventTickets.sol`. Type in code as follows:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.8;

contract EventTickets {

	address payable public organizer;
	mapping (address => uint) public registrantsPaid;
	uint public numRegistrants;
	uint public quota;

	event Deposit(address payable _from, uint _amount);  // log
	event Refund(address payable _to, uint _amount); // log
	event ValidationsPassed(address payable _sender, uint _value);

    // constructor
	constructor() public payable {
		organizer = msg.sender;
		quota = 100;
		numRegistrants = 0;
	}

	function buyTicket() public payable {
		require(numRegistrants < quota);
		emit ValidationsPassed(msg.sender, msg.value);
		registrantsPaid[msg.sender] += msg.value;
		numRegistrants++;
		emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
	}

	function changeQuota(uint newquota) public {
	    require(msg.sender == organizer && newquota > 0);
		emit ValidationsPassed(msg.sender, newquota);
		quota = newquota;
	}

	function refundTicket(address payable recipient, uint amount) public {
	    require(msg.sender == organizer);
		emit ValidationsPassed(msg.sender, amount);
		if (registrantsPaid[recipient] >= amount) {
			if (address(this).balance >= amount) {
				recipient.transfer(amount);
				emit Refund(recipient, amount);
				registrantsPaid[recipient] -= amount;
				numRegistrants--;
			}
		}
		return;
	}

	function destroy() public {
	    require(msg.sender == organizer);
		emit ValidationsPassed(msg.sender, address(this).balance);
	    selfdestruct(organizer);
	}
}
```
Create migrations file in migrations directory: 
`migrations/2_eventtickets_migration.js`. Type in the code as follows:
```bash
const EventTickets = artifacts.require("EventTickets");

module.exports = function(deployer, network, accounts) {
  // Change accounts id if want to set organiser as some other account
  deployer.deploy(EventTickets, {from: accounts[0]});
};

```
Compile and migrate new Smart Contract; or simply 'deploy':
```bash
$ truffle deploy
```
### Understanding the `EventTickets` Smart Contract code
* Solidity version: `pragma solidity ^0.5.8`, where `^` means that compiler 
also must be < version than `0.6.0`.

* Once deployed contracts also have addresses, similarly to user accounts.

* Events: contract logs - helpful when debugging a contract.

* Public, private functions.

* The `require()` usage in 'admin' functions.

* Payable functions always receive msg.sender and msg.value agruments. These 
can be passed as special - unnamed - arguments to the payable function:
`.buyTicket({ from: buyerAddress, value: ticketPrice })`.

* Selfdestruct: sends all current Smart Contract balance to given address 
(organizer), deletes all contract data and storage. Note: once destroy - contract
cannot be `restored` - also if one sends money to the destroy contract - 
these funds are lost forever. After destroy, one can deploy new contract by 
creating new migration file, see [FAQ](#FAQs) section below.

* Storing state in Smart Contracts - all attribute values are stored in 
Blockchain - in Ethereum Virtual Machine.

* Smart Contract 'price': the contract deployment (creation), 
also each contract call (function execution) cost the caller some `money`. This 
price is take from the contract caller address `msg.sender`. 

* Gas price and limit: gas - is a measure of computational power needed to 
deploy or execute Smart Contract. The actual contract execution price in Eth 
is calculated by multiplying gas used and gas price (attribute to change). 
Gas limit can be set when calling contract functions - if contract call is more 
`expensive` than set limit - contract will not be called. Read more about this 
in [FAQ](#FAQs) section below.

## 3. Test Smart Contract
In this section - we will setup testing network in truffle and write couple of 
Smart Contract tests. We will run these tests using the `truffle` tool.

### Setup test environment

Update `truffle-config.js` to have development and test networks:

```bash
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*"
    },
    test: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*"
    }
  }
}

```

Run tests using truffle:

```bash
$ truffle test
```
### First Smart Contract Test
Most popular languages to write Smart Contract tests in are solidity and 
javascript. In this workshop we will use javascript based tests. 
Some more good examples can be found online for both automated tests: 
[solidity](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/testing/writing-tests-in-solidity) 
and 
[javasript](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/testing/writing-tests-in-javascript).
To start with tests, add a test file in `test` directory called `EventTickets.js`.
Write first Smart Contract test as follows:

```javascript
const EventTickets = artifacts.require("EventTickets");

contract("EventTickets", accounts => {
  it("Testing initial contract variables", function(done) {
    EventTickets.deployed()  // accessing deployed EventTickets contract
    .then(function(instance){
        instance.quota.call()
        .then(quota => {
            assert.equal(
              quota,
              100,
              "Initial tickets quota has to be 100!"
            );
        })
        .then(function() {
          return instance.numRegistrants.call();
        }).then(function(num) {
            assert.equal(
                num, 
                0, 
                "Initial number of registrants should be zero!"
            );
          return instance.organizer.call();
          })
        .then(function(organizer) {
            assert.equal(
                organizer, 
                accounts[0], 
                "Organiser doesn't match!");
            done();
         })
        .catch(done);
    });
  });
});
```

### Test code walk through

* Usage of `contract()` will ensure the Smart Contract is redeployed and tests 
run on clean state.
* Tests are using `Ganache` local Blockchain network to deploy and call Smart 
Contract.
* Some libraries and objects are available in tests code out of the box: `web3`, 
`artifacts`, `assert`.
* Promises - all web3 functions calls are async. 
* Accessing variables values: usage of `call()`.

### Add more tests
Add more tests from the repo - you can find them 
[here](workshop/test/EventTickets.js).

## 4. Set up DApp UI
In this section - we will create decentralized application using the Smart 
Contract from previous steps and very simple javascript frontend application. 
We will run this application server. This will allow us to create User 
Interface for the Smart Contract that we just created and sell tickets for 
our event. 

### Setting up your DApp directory
Create new `app/` directory in your project root which will contain main app 
HTML and javascript files: `index.html` and `app.js`. You will also need 
`web3.js` and `jquery.js` libraries. Full [app/](workshop/app) directory should be 
copied from the tutorial code repo.

Create `bs-config.json` file that will have list of directories with your 
DApp UI code files. Note: the directories in this file
depends on your DApp source code location. Below assumes structure given 
in the tutorial code was used:
```bash
{
  "server": {
    "baseDir": ["./app", "./build/contracts"]
  }
}
```
Create `package.json` file in the root project directory with content as 
below:

```bash
{
  "name": "eventtickets",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "truffle-config.js",
  "directories": {
    "test": "test"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "lite-server",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "lite-server": "^2.5.4"
  },
  "dependencies": {
  }
}
```

### Serving the DApp
Before serving the DApp, `lite-server` npm dependency have to be installed. 
Once it is installed, `package-lock.json` file and `node_modules` directory 
will be automatically created in your project root.

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev lite-server
```

Serve the DApp website:
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

### Using the DApp

* Buy ticket: one can buy multiple tickets from the same account, change 
ticket price per ticket. One cannot buy more tickets if quota is reached.

* Refund ticket: only accounts that previously bought tickets - can be refunded, 
one cannot refund more than the account paid. Change refund price in sync with 
ticket price - else number of registrants adjusted incorrect (there is a 
[Bonus](#5-bonus-tasks) task to improve this).

* Change quota: change quota and try buying tickets above the quota.

* Ganache: observe number of transactions, blocks changing when buying tickets. 
Go to `Contracts` and check `EventTickets` contract balance, number of 
transactions, other attributes.

* Restart DApp (kill app process and start again): observe state (number 
of attendees, etc.) stays the same in the app.

* Start multiple DApp servers - observe how state is shared between those: if 
you buy ticket in one DApp instance, number of registrants increases in this and 
another instance of DApp (you might need to refresh the page).

* Destroy contract: once destroyed all contract balance is transferred to the 
organizer address (check the balance in `Ganache`). Read more about 
selfdestruct in the [FAQ](#FAQs) section below.

## 5. Bonus Tasks
Below you can find few bonus tasks that have no `copy-paste` solution in the 
repo. Following current code examples and `googling` if needed, you could:
* Add more Tests to the [EventTickets.js](workshop/test/EventTickets.js).
* Not allow to change quota to smaller than current number of registrants 
(suggested implementation - extend `requires` in the `changeQuota` function of 
the Smart Contract).
* Make organiser account an input field in the UI rather than hardcoded in the 
`app.js`. Also deploy new contract instance with organiser account being some 
other account from the test accounts list in `Ganache` (not default first one).
* Change amount paid by `buyerAddress` from total value to a 
list of ticket prices paid. Then in case of ticket price changes, refund 
of the previously purchased tickets would be validated (refund amount should 
exist in the list of purchased ticket prices). Also number of attendees would 
then be adjusted correctly. For simplicity only allow 1 ticket refund per click. 

## 6. Conclusions
This tutorial should have demonstrated a DApp with Smart Contract deployed on a 
Blockchain capabilities and benefits when creating User facing applications and 
processes automation. Now go and code a `Crowdsales` contract... no, just kidding, 
go and create something beautiful and useful instead.

## FAQs
* **How the number of blocks related to number of transactions?** 

The 1 transaction is in 1 Blockchain block in local testing Blockchain network. 
The number of transaction in a block in real Blockchain network, can varry, as it
depends on the `Gas` of the transactions. Currently the maximum block size in 
Ethereum is around 1,500,000 Gas.
* **How to `recreate` contract after self-destruct?**

Contract cannot be `recreated`, one can create new contract by defining new 
migration file in `migrations` directory. 
* **When contracts are called who and when pays for these contract calls?**
 
The caller - `msg.sender` - account pays for the contract call. Price is Gas 
used for a contract call multiplied by gas price. Gas price is `Ganache` is 
displayed at the top dashboard and can be changed (price is in `wei`: 
1 Wei = 0.000000000000000001 Eth).
* **Is contract state kept between application restarts?** 

Yes, if DApp access already deployed contract instance from Blockchain by using 
this construct - same Smart Contract instance is retrieved:
```javascript
    $.getJSON('EventTickets.json', function(data) {
    var EventTicketsArtifact = data;
    EventTickets = TruffleContract(EventTicketsArtifact);
    // Set the provider for our contract.
    EventTickets.setProvider(web3Provider);
    EventTickets.deployed().then(
       function(instance) {
           console.log('Smart Contract Instance', instance);
    ...
``` 
The state (number of registrants, contract balance, buyers addresses etc.) 
lives in Blockchain and is retained between decentralized application restarts. 
Also DApp can be served from multiple application nodes.
* **How one can set some other account to be organisers account, rather than first 
from `Ganache` list?**

Just sent different account index in the migration file, for example if you want 
second account to be `organisers` account do this:
```javascript
module.exports = function(deployer, network, accounts) {
  // Change accounts id if want to set organiser as some other account
  deployer.deploy(EventTickets, {from: accounts[1]});
};
```
Note: do not forget to change `organisers_account` constant in the `app.js`!
* **Which one of the development tools is Ethereum Virtual Machine, Ethereum Node 
and Ethereum Blockchain network.** 

The `Ganache` is private Ethereum Blockchain network. In the workshop setup 
there is no separate Ethereum Node, as `Ganache` comes with RPC server which 
plays Ethereum Node role. The `Ganache` also executes Smart Contracts, 
therefore is implements Ethereum Virtual Machine. The truffle is a tool 
that interacts with Ethereum Virtual Machine and allows easy contract: 
compilation, deployment, testing and migrations.
